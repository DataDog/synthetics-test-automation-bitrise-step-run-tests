  Step to run Datadog Synthetic tests on your CI

  With this Step you can run Synthetic tests during your Bitrise CI and ensure all your teams using Bitrise can benefit from Synthetic tests at every stage of the software lifecycle.

  To use this Step:
  - Create Synthetic tests in Datadog. See [Synthetic Monitoring documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/synthetics/) for a detailed explanation.
  - Upload and build your app in the CI.
  - Configure and run this Step in your Bitrise workflow.

  This Step will:
  - Run the Synthetic tests that have been configured through the inputs.
  - Fail your CI if there are any issues.
  - Upload the results to Datadog.

  For examples of how the inputs of this Step can be configured check the [README for this step](https://github.com/DataDog/synthetics-test-automation-bitrise-step-run-tests)
